  <h1>Anirudh Ravichander</h1>
  <p>
Anirudh Ravichander, born on October 16, 1990, in Chennai, India, is a prominent Indian music composer and playback singer. He gained widespread recognition with his debut song "Why This Kolaveri Di" in 2011, which became a viral sensation and showcased his innovative musical style. Anirudh is known for his ability to blend various genres seamlessly, creating energetic and catchy compositions. He has composed music for numerous successful films and has been praised for his youthful and contemporary approach to music in the Indian film industry. As of my last update in September 2021, he continues to be a dynamic force in the music scene.
